# Katana ZERO Weapons
Terraria mod that aims to add all 7 katanas from Katana ZERO into Terraria as their own weapons.

Current mod status: Fifteen's Blade scales properly with every boss, and it also works with Calamity or Thorium

# Weapons Added:
- ZERO's Katana: The original, no special effects, just bullet deflection 
(Early Pre-Hardmode)

- Prism Sword: Slightly increased stats from the original, with a colorful slash 
(Late Pre-Hardmode)

- Sword of Masters: Slower attack speed, increased range, shoots a projectile, more hits per slash (Post-Destroyer)

- Savant Knife: Faster attack speed, low range, high amount of hits per slash (Post-Mechs)

- Claymore Prototype: Slow attack speed, big hit range and width, unlimited amount of bullet deflections per swing (Post-Golem)

- Phoenix's Edge: Slow attack speed, very high range, shoots flames that burn enemies (Post-Cultist)

- Fifteen's Blade: High attack speed, very high reach, teleports to the mouse cursor on holding and releasing right click, meant to most enemies in one hit (Legendary Weapon)
	- Has 1/40000 chance to drop from any hostile enemy, or 1/9 to drop from Moon Lord.

# Extra Info
- This mod is made by me in attempt to learn the ropes of programming, There might be bugs I haven't found yet that could break the mod.
- If you are more experienced and want to help me making this weapon better, send me a DM on Discord (darkosto0) and I'll gladly reach back.
- I plan on making the mod better with time like making special effects but that will be left for the future.
