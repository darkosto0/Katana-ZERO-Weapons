# Katana ZERO Weapons
Terraria mod that aims to add all 7 katanas from Katana ZERO into Terraria as their own weapons.

[Steam Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3289273898)

Current mod status: Fifteen's Blade scales properly with every boss, and it also works with Calamity or Thorium

# Weapons Added:
Zero's Katana: The original, no special effects, just bullet deflection 
(Early Pre-Hardmode)

Prism Sword: Slightly increased stats from the original, with a colorful slash 
(Late Pre-Hardmode)

Sword of Masters: Slower attack speed, increased range, shoots a projectile that penetrates enemies, more hits per slash (Post-Destroyer)

Savant Knife: Very fast attack speed, low range, high amount of hits per slash, easier bullet deflection (Post-Mechs)

Claymore Prototype: Slow attack speed, big hit range and width, unlimited amount of bullet deflections per swing (Post-Golem)

Phoenix's Edge: Medium attack speed, very high range, shoots flames that burn enemies (Post-Cultist)

Fifteen's Blade: High attack speed, very high reach, teleports to the mouse cursor on holding and releasing right click, meant to kill most enemies in one hit (Legendary Weapon)
- Has 1/40000 chance to drop from any hostile enemy, or 1/9 chance from Moon Lord
