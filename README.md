(Late Pre-Hardmode)

- Claymore Prototype: Slow attack speed, big hit range and width, unlimited amount of bullet deflections per swing (Post-Golem)

- Phoenix's Edge: Slow attack speed, very high range, shoots flames that burn enemies (Post-Cultist)

- Fifteen's Blade: High attack speed, very high reach, teleports to the cursor on holding and releasing right click, meant to kill most enemies in one hit (Legendary Weapon)
	- Has 1/40000 chance to drop from any hostile enemy, or 1/9 to drop from Moon Lord.
