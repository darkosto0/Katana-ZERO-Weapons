# Katana-ZERO-Weapons
Terraria mod that aims to add all 7 katanas from Katana ZERO into Terraria as their own weapons.

- Items Added:

Sword of Masters: Everything done, projectile shot not implemented.

ZERO's Katana: Everything Works.

Prism Sword: The same as ZERO's Katana, but increased stats.

the code here in this repo is actual trash and i dont recommend anyone to learn anything from it, it is mostly made by chatgpt and i stitched everything together, cause i dont know shit about math and vectors for this game i had to get assistance.

you are free to use this code however you see fit, as for the MIT License
