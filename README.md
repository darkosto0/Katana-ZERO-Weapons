# Katana ZERO Weapons
Terraria mod that aims to add all 7 katanas from Katana ZERO into Terraria as their own weapons.

Current mod status: Mostly finalized, unless I get the spark to resume

[Steam Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3289273898)

# Weapons Added:
- ZERO's Katana: The original, no special effects, just bullet deflection 
(Early Pre-Hardmode)

- Prism Sword: Slightly increased stats from the original, with a colorful slash 
(Late Pre-Hardmode)

- Sword of Masters: Slower attack speed, increased range, shoots a projectile, more hits per slash (Post-Destroyer)

- Savant Knife: Faster attack speed, low range, high amount of hits per slash (Post-Mechs)

- Claymore Prototype: Slow attack speed, big hit range and width, unlimited amount of bullet deflections per swing (Post-Golem)

- Phoenix's Edge: Slow attack speed, very high range, shoots flames that burn enemies (Post-Cultist)

- Fifteen's Blade: High attack speed, very high reach, teleports to the cursor on holding and releasing right click, meant to kill most enemies in one hit (Legendary Weapon)
	- Has 1/40000 chance to drop from any hostile enemy, or 1/9 to drop from Moon Lord.
