The Katana ZERO Mod adds the seven katanas from the game Katana ZERO to Terraria. 
These weapons have unique slashing animations, can deflect bullets, and lunge you forward like the original game.

* Weapons Added *

- ZERO's Katana: The original, no special effects, just bullet deflection 
(Early Pre-Hardmode)

- Prism Sword: Slightly increased stats from the original, with a colorful slash 
(Late Pre-Hardmode)

- Sword of Masters: Slower attack speed, increased range, shoots a projectile, more hits per slash (Post-Destroyer)

- Savant Knife: Faster attack speed, low range, high amount of hits per slash (Post-Mechs)

- Claymore Prototype: Slow attack speed, big hit range and width, unlimited amount of bullet deflections per swing (Post-Golem)

- Phoenix's Edge: Slow attack speed, very high range, shoots flames that burn enemies (Post-Cultist)

- Fifteen's Blade: High attack speed, very high reach, teleports to the mouse cursor on holding and releasing right click, meant to most enemies in one hit (Legendary Weapon)
Has 1/40000 chance to drop from any enemy, or 1/9 to drop from Moon Lord.
