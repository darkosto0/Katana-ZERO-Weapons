	As you can see, every config that you change will force you to reload the mod.
	This is because I've tested everything and confirmed that changes don't take effect without a reload.
	If you have any experience in modding or programming in general, I will be more than happy to work with you in fixing this.
	You can add me on Discord @darkosto0 (It's a zero at the end) if you're interested.

	Toggling this does nothing
